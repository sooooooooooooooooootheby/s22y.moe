hhhi! I'm ` sooooooooooooooooootheby`, you can also call me `s22y` or `alice`.

`alice` 's full name is `Alice Clodia`, this is a vampire name.

I like to use `Nuxt` to develop full-stack project, and I'm a full-stack engineer (It's probably like this).

And I have been studying `Java` recently, Because I need it to make my Graduation Project.

## Blog

When I encounter some strange problems and solve them, I will write about them on my blog.

Or when I learn some new skills, I will record them on my blog.

-> [Blog](/blog)

## Project

I enjoy making some useless little tools. If these little tools can be of help to you, I will be very happy.

## Contact

You can find me on various platforms by `sooooooooooooooooootheby` or `s22y`, as long as I'm there.

- [Github](https://github.com/sooooooooooooooooootheby)
- [Twitter](https://x.com/sooootheby)
- [Linux.do](https://linux.do/u/s22y/summary)

The names in front are used on some social platforms. If you see 'AliceIClodia' or 'AliceHClodia' in the game, it's very likely to be me.

## About this website

This website is built with `Nuxt`.

It's inspired by [vereis.com](https://vereis.com/), and I really like the retro style.

The color scheme is from [rose pine](https://rosepinetheme.com/zh-cn/palette/): Rose, Foam, Iris.

And This is a English version of the website, if you need Chinese version, please visit [blog.s22y.moe](https://blog.s22y.moe/).

Because my English is not good, I use AI assisted translation. If you find some strange sentences, please leave me a message -> [GitHub](https://github.com/sooooooooooooooooootheby/s22y.moe/issues)

> if you ask me: why to use English in this website? Because I'm think appearance of English characters is better than that of Chinese characters.
