hhi! I am `sooooooooooooooooootheby`, you can also call me `s22y` or `alice`!

I like using `Nuxt` to develop full-stack projects; I'm a so-so ~~full-stack engineer~~. Recently, I've been learning `Java` because I need it for my graduation project (thesis).

## Blog

Whenever I encounter a strange problem and successfully solve it, I'll record it on my Blog.

Or if I learn a new skill, I'll also write it down.

-> [Blog](/blog)

## Project

I enjoy making some useless little gadgets, and I would be very happy if they could help you.

## Contact

You can find me by the names `sooooooooooooooooootheby` or `s22y` on various platforms, provided I'm there.

- [Github](https://github.com/sooooooooooooooooootheby)
- [Twitter](https://x.com/sooootheby)
- [Linux.do](https://linux.do/u/s22y/summary)

The above names are for social platforms. If you run into a player named `AliceIClodia` or `AliceHClodia` in a game, that's probably me.

## About this website

This blog is implemented using `Nuxt`.

It was inspired by [vereis.com](https://vereis.com/); I really like retro things.

The color scheme comes from [rose pine](https://rosepinetheme.com/zh-cn/palette/): Rose, Foam, Iris.
